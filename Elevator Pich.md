We want to offer the costumer a different want buy a motorbyke. Instead of showing lots of bikes, we show just one, and with a very simple choice, do you like it or not. We will keep showing you one at a time. At a later date you can go to this list where you will see all thhe ones you liked, their info and even go to the Mundimoto to buy it. But the more interesting part is happening here. These four axis represent your taste in bikes. Are you searching for a cheap or expensive bike, new or old. These ajust every time you make a choice and we also use them to choose what bike to show you next, so the more you choose the more you will like the bikes we show you, You also have some traditional filters if you only want to see scooters.
